Hi, My name is Zhuoran WANG (王卓然), I am now a Ph.D. student in Financial Technology at *The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)* under the supervision of Dr. Ying ZHANG. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Finance from *Nanjing Agricultural University* in June 2024.

My research interests focus on *numerical algorithms in stochastic Langevin dynamics and their applications in finance*, including numerical algorithms design, convergence analysis, numerical simulation, and financial applications.
