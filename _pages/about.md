Hi, My name is Zhuoran WANG (王卓然), I am now a Ph.D. student in Financial Technology at *The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)* under the supervision of Dr. Ying ZHANG. Before that, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Finance from *Nanjing Agricultural University* in June 2024.

My primary focus is on the design of numerical algorithms for stochastic Langevin differential equations and their applications in finance and machine learning. More specifically, I use tools from probability theory and stochastic calculus to study the underdamped (or kinetic) Langevin equation through methods such as the Euler–Maruyama algorithm, sampling, and coupling. I also explore related topics in stochastic optimization, pricing and financial risk management, as well as applications in machine learning.
