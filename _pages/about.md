Hi, My name is Zhuoran WANG (王卓然), I am now a Phd student at the Financial Technology Thrust, [Society Hub](https://soch.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), [the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/). My supervisor is Prof. [Ying ZHANG (张莹)](https://sites.google.com/view/ying-zhang/home?authuser=0). Before that, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in Finance from [Nanjing Agricultural University](https://www.njau.edu.cn/) in June 2024.

My research interests focus on *numerical algorithms in stochastic Langevin dynamics and their applications in finance*, including numerical algorithms design, convergence analysis, numerical simulation, and financial applications.
